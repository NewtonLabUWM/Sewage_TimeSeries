# Urban wastewater bacterial communities assemble into seasonal steady states
### E. Lou LaMartina, Aurash A. Mohaimani, Ryan J. Newton

Microorganisms have colonized urban sanitary sewers and exhibit community properties that suggest sewers are a novel ecosystem. These microbial communities present both an opportunity as a control point for treatment processes and a risk to human health. If waste treatment processes are to be improved and human health risks quantified, then it is necessary to understand the microbial players and their dynamics within this source community. Here we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize raw wastewater microbial communities in a five-year time series of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Milwaukee, WI; 73 WWTPs across the United States (US); and in Milwaukee residential sewers. In Milwaukee, we find the human microbiome component of wastewater decreases in community proportion during transit from residences to the WWTP and exhibits more stochastic temporal variation. In contrast, the resident sewer community cycles seasonally, assembling into two distinct states each year. Temporal trends in wastewater microbial communities from other northern US cities mirror those observed in Milwaukee, but southern US cities have a distinct community composition and differ in their seasonal assembly patterns. Our findings provide evidence that a robust bacterial community is resident within sewer pipes and influenced by environmental conditions associated with seasonal change and climatic differences based on geographic location.
